This is a repo for a project I completed for a machine learning course. 

This ML model is based on a credit default risk dataset and looks to predictively classify whether a not 
a lender will default on a loan based on 14 different features.

I have picked up the project again and am looking to make improvements on both the neural network and decision tree.

Neural net has ~89% accuracy and decision tree has ~84% accuracy at this point. Looking to make sone tweaks to improve model performance.

Feel free to make any contributions or suggestions.
